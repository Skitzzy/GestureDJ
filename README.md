# GestureDJ
GDJ is a project I worked on for my 3rd year computer music module. 

It uses a Leap Motion motion capture device and requires the associated Leap Motion SDK to work

The SDK provides access to the frame and tracking points on the hand and fingers. 
These are used to define gestures that can control audio playback through a python script.

Currently implemented features:

-2 track player

-regular playback controls through swiping gestures

-DSP effects, low pass filter on individual tracks through gestures

-stereo volume and panning through gestures
